# AI-Based Mind Map Generator

DISCLAIMER!!! Ai has been used in this project (copilot for coding help)

This project provides a tool for generating mind maps using AI. It allows users to create, edit, and visualize their ideas in an interactive mind map format. This tool will be powered by ai!

## Features

- AI-generated mind maps: The AI creates nodes and relationships based on input prompt/data.
- Interactive visualization: Users can interact with nodes and edges, edit labels, and create new connections.
- Export options: Export your mind maps in various formats (PNG, JPEG).
- Two Themes: Switch between dark and light themes for better visualization.

## Screenshots

Here are some examples of an ai generated mind map about WW2 both in dark and light mode and the exported version:
